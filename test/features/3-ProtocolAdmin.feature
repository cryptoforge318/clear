Feature: Administer Protocol

    As the Protocol Admin,
    I want to set the feeTo address and sweep any fees accrued,
    so that the protocol can generate revenue and in turn continue innovating on Ethereum options.

    (note: sweeping fees is not a permissioned function, but fits best in this user story)

    Background: XYZ

    Scenario: Set feeTo address

    Scenario: Sweep fees for single token

    Scenario: Sweep fees for multiple tokens
