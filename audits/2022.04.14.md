## Findings

## High
### 1. User can excercise option after expiration
An additional requirement needs to be added into exercise to ensure protocol works as intended.

**Suggestion:** add a

```
require(block.timestamp <= optionRecord.expiryTimestamp)
```

statement within `exercise()`.

## Informational
### 2. Logic within `assignExercise()` can be incrementally optimized
The statement:
```
if (amountWritten <= amount) {
    amount -= amountWritten;
    claimRecord.amountExercised = amountWritten;
    // We pop the end off and overwrite the old slot
} else {
    claimRecord.amountExercised = amount;
    amount = 0;
}
```
can be rewritten as:
```
if (amountWritten < amount) {
    amount -= amountWritten;
    claimRecord.amountExercised = amountWritten;
    // We pop the end off and overwrite the old slot
} else {
    claimRecord.amountExercised = amount;
    amount = 0;
}
```
So that when `amountWritten == amount`, the `amount` is set to 0, eliminating an unnecessary mathematical calculation.

Both of these issues are now resolved and have passing tests cases.
